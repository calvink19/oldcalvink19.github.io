Includes articles on how to:

- [*Fix YT app on iOS 4/5/6*](https://calvink19.github.io/tuberepair)
- [*Fix the iOS 4/5/6 appstore*](https://calvink19.github.io/storebroken)

Agenda:
- [ ] tweak recommendations
- [x] more tutorials
- [x] moving all articles to a seperate folder
- [x] rewriting everything in MD since I'm too lazy to learn CSS. *(note- kept index in html since I'm still too lazy to rewrite it)*
